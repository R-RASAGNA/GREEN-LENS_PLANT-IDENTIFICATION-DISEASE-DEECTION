# GREEN-LENS_PLANT-IDENTIFICATION-DISEASE-DEECTION

GreenLens - AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection

Overview

GreenLens is a web-based AI application designed to identify plant species and detect plant diseases from user-uploaded images. The project leverages the power of ResNet-34, a deep learning model, to analyze plant images and provide accurate diagnoses. This repository contains the core components required for dataset extraction, model training, and disease detection.

Features

Plant Disease Identification: Detects various plant diseases based on leaf images.

ResNet-34 Model: Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for accurate classification.

Dataset Handling: Scripts to preprocess and extract plant disease datasets.

Model Training & Testing: Notebooks for training and evaluating the model.

Web-Based Integration: Designed for easy integration into a user-friendly application.
